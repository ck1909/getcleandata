README
============

The repo **getcleandata** contains the following files:
- CodeBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and data cleaning transformations performed
- README.md
- run_analysis.R that contains the functions for getting, cleaning, and outputting the data
- tidy_dataset.txt that shows the clean dataset outputted by running the main() function of run_analysis.R

Note: For simplicity, the run_analysis.R script assumes that all raw data files are located in the working directory. But you can modify the file paths if required (e.g. f_x_test <- "/some_directory/X_test.txt").
